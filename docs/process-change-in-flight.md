# Changing a process that is already running

Management removes the operations manager's approval from the quotation process. Three
hundred quotations are already in flight, and thirty of them are sitting in that person's
inbox right now. What happens to them?

This document is the analysis and the answer. It covers what breaks, what is safe, when
changing in flight is the *right* call, and what the engine now does about each.

## 0. First, the thing most teams get wrong

Scheduling a release for next Monday does **not** mean the operations manager stops
approving on Monday.

A quotation submitted Sunday night starts on v1. It reaches the operations step on
*Tuesday* — two days after the cutover. The population parked on a removed node keeps
growing after the cutover date. The real horizon is:

```
cutover + the longest time for an already-started instance to reach that node
```

So separate the two intents before anything else, because they need different mechanisms:

| What management means | Mechanism | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| "New quotations follow the new rules from Monday" | The release timeline alone | **Works today.** `ScheduleRelease`, `ProcessDefinitionReleaseModel` |
| "Nobody performs an operations approval after Monday" | Release timeline **+ a migration of the stragglers** | Needs the migration in §5 |

The release timeline is a pure function of `(rows, now)` — the newest row whose
`activate_at` has passed. No scheduler wakes up, nothing is missed because a replica was
restarting, every replica agrees without coordinating. And it says nothing about running
instances: those pin their definition by ID and drain on the version they started on. That
is also the correct legal default — the rules in force when a quotation was submitted
generally govern that quotation.

## 1. The three populations

A single removal is not one question. It is three, and only one of them is hard.

| Population | Where the token is | Answer |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **A — already past** | on `salesApprove` | Migrate. The node exists in both versions. Nothing to decide. |
| **B — parked on the removed node** | in the operations manager's inbox | **The business decision.** |
| **C — not yet arrived** | on `supervisorReview`, or not started | Migrate. They should never see the removed step. |

Population B has no technically correct answer, only a business one:

- **B1 — honour it.** The change is policy going forward; approvals already requested get
  finished. → let those instances drain on v1. *This is the default and it is free.*
- **B2 — deem it granted.** The role was eliminated; pending approvals are moot. → skip the
  step, and record that it was skipped, by whom, and why.
- **B3 — void it.** The step was a mistake; the pending approval is invalid. → cancel or
  send the instance back.

No engine can choose for you. What an engine owes you is the ability to *express* the
choice, apply it to only the instances it should apply to, and leave a trail an auditor can
read.

## 2. Negative cases — what breaks

### Class A: silent corruption (worst — no error, wrong outcome)

`ProcessInstance` carries **four** structures identified by node ID:

```go
CompletedNodes   []string                       // the "already done" guard
CompensatedNodes []string
MultiInstance    map[string]MultiInstanceState  // progress through a per-item node
Joins            map[string]int                 // branches arrived at each waiting gateway
```

Before this work, `apply()` wrote **exactly three row types** — the instance's definition ID
and token node IDs, `task.NodeID`, and the job's node and definition ID. Which generalises
to a rule worth keeping:

> **Anything keyed by node ID that is not a token, a task or a job was, by construction,
> left pointing at the old graph.**

Three consequences, in severity order. All three bite only when a mapping **renames** a node
(`from != to`) — which is exactly what `opsApprove → salesApprove` is.

| Case | What happened | Now |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Renamed join gateway** | `Joins["opsJoin"]` orphaned, `Joins["newJoin"]` reads 0. The gateway waits forever for a branch that already arrived. No error — the instance just never finishes. | Rekeyed. `TestMigrationRekeysJoinCountersSoTheJoinStillCompletes` |
| **Multi-instance mid-collection** | `IsMultiInstanceActive` finds nothing under the new ID and **re-enters the node** — everyone is asked again, and the approvals already given appear twice. | Rekeyed |
| **Completed-node guard stranded** | `IsCompleted` loses its record, so an activity can run a second time. For a service task that charges a card, that is the double-firing incident `AGENTS.md` §0 names. | Rekeyed; unmapped entries kept, because a step the new version deleted is still a step this instance performed |

Two mappings cannot merge onto one target if both sides carry a counter: adding two arrival
counts together invents branches that never arrived, and dropping one loses a branch that
did. That is refused (`TestMigrationRefusesToMergeTwoCounters`).

### Class B: the data contract — the one everyone forgets

**A removed user task is a removed *data producer*, not just a removed step.**

The operations manager does not only approve. They set `riskTier`, `approvedCreditLimit`,
`marginOverrideReason`. Downstream, a gateway branches on `riskTier` and the sales manager's
form pre-fills from `approvedCreditLimit`.

Delete the node and those variables are never written. At the gateway, no condition matches.

Metis behaves **correctly and loudly** here — §0 forbids falling back to `flows[0]`, so it
raises an incident. But understand the operational shape: migrate 300 instances at 2am and
you get **300 simultaneous incidents at the same gateway**, from a change nobody connected
to gateway logic.

**The worse variant:** if that gateway has a **default flow**, there is no incident. Every
instance silently takes the default. High-risk quotations route as low-risk, and you find
out at quarter-end.

The plan now walks the target graph forward from every landing node and warns about exactly
this. It also lists `RemovedNodes` whether or not anything sits on one, because that is the
first thing a reviewer needs.

### Class C: structural attachment

- **Boundary events could be detached.** A three-day escalation on `approve` is not a
  three-day escalation on whatever else the target attaches one to. The planner checked only
  that target nodes *exist*. Camunda 8 refuses exactly this shape; Metis now does too
  (`boundaryRefusals`).
- **Message subscriptions.** Follows from the three-row-types rule: migration does not write
  subscriptions, so one still naming the old node will receive a callback for a node that no
  longer exists. **Still open** — see §6.

### Class D: concurrency

The operations manager has the form open and clicks Submit at the instant migration runs.
There is no optimistic locking on tasks or instances. **Still open** — see §6. This is why
`Claimed` and `Delegated` now count separately in the plan: an unclaimed task is a queue
item, a claimed one is a person mid-sentence.

### Class E: control and compliance

- **Segregation of duties collapses quietly.** The operations approval may exist so that no
  single reporting line approves its own deal. Remove it and in some org paths the
  submitter's own manager becomes the only approver. Auditors look for evidence that no
  single role can complete the transaction loop.
- **Delegation-of-authority thresholds.** DoA matrices are value-banded. Remove the step that
  caught everything under $50k and those quotations now need an approval the matrix does not
  authorise — or skip approval entirely.
- **Retroactive legal effect.** Migrating a Friday quotation onto Monday's rules applies
  terms that did not exist when the customer was quoted.
- **Conformance checking breaks.** A migrated instance is a trace no single model explains.
  If the log cannot distinguish *migrated* from *deviant*, compliance analysis is noise.
  Fixed by the audit event: `instance_migrated`.

### Class F: blast radius and reversibility

- **Shared sub-processes.** An approval invoked by twelve parents via call activity is twelve
  processes, not one.
- **You cannot un-skip.** Release rollback works (`TestPromotingAnOlderVersionRollsBack`).
  Instance migration is not symmetric: a cancelled approval task cannot be resurrected.

## 3. Positive cases — when migrating is right

These are real and underweighted. In each, **not** migrating is the larger risk.

1. **The dead queue (strongest).** The approver resigns; the assignment resolves to an empty
   group. Three hundred quotations are frozen forever — drain never completes. Removing the
   node is the only way to release real revenue. This is recovery, not risk-taking.
2. **A broken assignment or condition.** Same shape, bug instead of attrition.
3. **Regulatory stop.** A step becomes *illegal*. "We will keep breaking the rule for the 400
   instances already running" is not a position you can hold. Drain is wrong by definition.
4. **Compromise response.** An approver's account is compromised; every pending approval by
   them is suspect and must be re-routed now.
5. **Scale economics.** 5,000 in-flight loans × two days saved. Drain would take months.
6. **Continuity.** A wet-signature step becomes impossible.
7. **SLA rescue.** A bottleneck approval breaching contractual penalties.
8. **Compounding modelling error.** Every day of drain adds wrong outcomes to remediate.

Cases 1–4 are *the population is already broken*. Cases 5–8 are *waiting has an accruing
cost*. **If your case fits neither, drain.**

## 4. The triage

Four questions, in order. Stop at the first that decides.

1. **Is the in-flight population healthy?** Can every parked instance still progress by
   itself? If **no** → §3, migrate. The engine risk is bounded; the alternative is permanent.
2. **Does the removed node produce data later steps consume?** Check `RemovedNodes` and the
   default-flow warnings in the plan. A downstream gateway with a default flow is a *silent*
   divergence, not a loud one.
3. **Does the node carry a control obligation?** Mark it `compliance_relevant` and the plan
   will hold rather than let it pass unremarked.
4. **Can you wait?** Compare the **drain horizon** from §0 against the business deadline. If
   it fits, drain and build nothing.

## 5. What the engine does now

### Refusals (block the apply)

| Refusal | Why |
| :-- | :-- |
| Work parked where the target has no node | The original check; a stranded token cannot be un-stranded |
| Engine bookkeeping with nowhere to land | Names the counter, not just the token riding on it |
| Two counters merging onto one node | No correct way to add two arrival counts together |
| A boundary event moved off its activity | A timer firing against work that is not running |
| A mapping naming a node the target lacks | A typo, wrong regardless of what is running |
| Different process keys or projects | Not a version change |
| **An unacknowledged control obligation** | See below |

### Warnings (do not block)

- A downstream gateway with a **default flow**, which would route silently instead of raising
  an incident when a variable the removed step used to set is missing.
- Tasks **claimed or delegated right now**, which go back to the queue.

Warnings are kept separate from refusals deliberately: a warning dressed as an error teaches
people to click past the list, and then a real refusal gets clicked past too.

### Compliance holds

A node marked `compliance_relevant` (with an optional `compliance_note`) produces a **hold**
when the migration would take it away from instances that have not performed it yet. A hold
is a refusal the operator may accept **by name**:

```
POST /api/v1/definitions/versions/migrate
{ "node_mapping": {...}, "acknowledge": ["opsApprove"] }
```

Three properties make this worth having:

- **Only pending instances count.** An instance that already gave the approval waived
  nothing and must not read as though it did.
- **The obligation must *land* on a node that carries one too.** Existing is not enough:
  mapping `opsApprove` onto `salesApprove` lands the token perfectly and still means nobody
  performs the check. A version that keeps the node ID but drops the marking has removed the
  control just as surely as deleting the node would.
- **Node IDs, not a blanket flag.** An override people set once and forget is one they stop
  reading, and it would carry over to whatever the plan holds next time.

The acknowledgement and the authoriser's name are written to every affected instance's
timeline. This is entirely additive: a definition that marks nothing behaves exactly as
before.

### Re-derived assignment

A task that changes node is **rebuilt from the node it lands on** — name, description, type,
priority, due date, form, assignee, candidate users and groups — and its claim is dropped.

Carrying the task across was an authorisation bug: a task mapped from `opsApprove` onto
`salesApprove` kept the operations manager as assignee and candidate group, which let the
person whose step had just been deleted complete the step that replaced it, while the sales
manager never saw it. Camunda preserves the assignee across migration, but only because it
requires the two activities to be semantically equivalent first; nothing here can establish
that, so the safe default is the other one.

### Audit

Every migrated instance gets an `instance_migrated` entry naming the source and target
version, which work was re-pointed, who authorised it, and which controls were waived.
Written outside the unit of work: a migration that succeeded should not roll back because
the audit write failed, and a lost entry is logged loudly.

### Scheduled cutovers

`DeleteDefinition` now refuses a version a future release names. A version scheduled for
next Monday has run nothing, so every other check passed it — and deleting it left the
timeline naming a version that was not there, whereupon the reader falls back to the highest
one and whatever draft was deployed in the meantime goes live at the scheduled moment.
Unattended, with no error raised anywhere.

## 6. Still open

| Gap | Why it is not done here |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Optimistic locking** on tasks and instances | Needs a schema migration and conflict handling in every writer, on the hot path of every task completion. Large enough to deserve its own change with its own proof. |
| **Message subscriptions** are not rewritten by migration | Follows from the three-row-types rule. Camunda closes subscriptions for unmapped catch events; the equivalent here needs a decision about what "unmapped" should mean for a correlation key. |
| **Per-node *actions*** (`Skip` / `Cancel` / `Hold`) rather than only `MapTo` | The B2 and B3 answers in §1 remain inexpressible: you can only move work, not decide it never happens. This is the largest remaining item and the one that would make §1's decision fully representable. |
| **Instance selection** on a plan | One mapping still applies to every instance on the source version, so populations A, B and C get one policy. |
| **Migration as a durable, resumable entity** | `apply` still loops instances in per-instance transactions and returns on first error, so a partial run is neither visible nor resumable. |
| **SoD / DoA as first-class constraints** | `compliance_relevant` marks *that* a step carries an obligation, not *what* it is. Modelling "not the same person as X" or "over $50k" belongs with the RBAC work in the roadmap. |

## 7. For the quotation process specifically

The operations-approval node almost certainly writes variables the sales manager's step
reads, and `opsApprove → salesApprove` is a rename. Before this work, that one
plausible-looking mapping would have stranded the bookkeeping, carried the wrong authority,
and potentially produced an incident storm — three independent failures from one line of
JSON.

It is now refused or corrected on every count. **Drain is still the right answer for a
healthy population**; what changed is that the day you hit a §3 emergency and do not have
that luxury, the migration will not quietly make things worse.
